# AsyncAPI Preview

Preview AsyncAPI documents inside VSCode.

AsyncAPI Preview was simplified and reworked from scratch to use the latest [@asyncapi/asyncapi-react](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-react/tree/next), removing old dependencies on Express, socket.io and js-yaml with better startup performance and bundle size.

You can open AsyncAPI Preview from the editor title/context menu.

- `add asyncapi subscribe to async request`: Inserts a new subscribe operation, for listening to incoming async requests/commands.
